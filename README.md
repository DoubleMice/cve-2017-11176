## about
My first try to code my own LPE exploit.



## reference
- [lexfo:linux-kernel-exploitation](https://blog.lexfo.fr/)

    While this guy's work was based on Debian8.6.0(kernel version:3.16.36).
    But honestly,his articles are very nice to the freshman who wants to enjoy kernel exploit.
    Thanks.
